# Challenge 1: Smallest Change

## Description

Write a function that takes an amount of change (in pence), and returns the shortest list of coins that add up to the specified amount.

## Rules & Assumptions

* Use any language
* The amount will always be a positive integer less than 5000
* If the amount is zero, return an empty list
* Use standard UK coinage

This is an easy challenge, so see how small you can make the code, or maybe use an esoteric language!

## Example

Input: `234`

Output: `[200, 20, 10, 2, 2]`
